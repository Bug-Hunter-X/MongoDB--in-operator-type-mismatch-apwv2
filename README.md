# MongoDB $in operator type mismatch
This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries.  The `$in` operator is used to check if a field's value exists in a given array. However, if the data types of the field and the array elements do not match, the query may not return the expected results.

In this example, the `field` is of type integer, but the array includes a string value ('3').  MongoDB will perform a type-based comparison, leading to incorrect results.

The solution shows how to ensure type consistency for accurate query results.
